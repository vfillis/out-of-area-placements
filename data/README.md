# The data

Data on Out of Area Placements in Mental Health services from between October 2016 and October 2020 was downloaded from [NHS Digital](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/out-of-area-placements-in-mental-health-services).

The individual CSVs can be merged using the command line.

After navigating with **cd** to the folder that contained the CSV, I used "cat *.csv > oaps2016to2020.csv" to combine them. 

The data then was analysed in R. You can find more about the analysis [here](https://github.com/vfillis/out-of-area-placements/tree/main/analysis).
