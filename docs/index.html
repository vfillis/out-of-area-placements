<div class="text">
  <p><span class="first-word">I</span>nappropriate Out of Area Placements (OAPs) are as high as two years ago</p>
  <p>685 patients were still inappropriately placed outside their area for mental health treatment in England at the end of October 2020.</p>
  <p>Inappropriate Out of Area Placements (OAPs) in mental health services are as high as two years ago recent data published by NHS England shows.</p>
  <p>Inappropriate Out of Area Placements are where patients are sent out of their area because no bed is available for them locally. </p>
  <p>The UK Government has set a national ambition to eliminate inappropriate Out of Area Placements in mental health services for adults in acute inpatient care by 2020/21, but the number is only slowly decreasing. </p> 
  <p>There is no significant change from two years ago when 645 inappropriate Out of Area Placements were recorded in October 2018. </p>

  <p>During the lockdown inappropriate Out of Area Placements have gone down, reaching their lowest point since records began in April 2020.</p>
  <p>This can be due to less mental health referrals during the lockdown, but also due to fewer providers submitting data. While normally around 95% of providers submit data about Out of Area Placements, the number went down to 79% in April.</p>
  <p>The decrease has been only temporary. Since May, inappropriate Out of Area Placements are going up to pre-lockdown levels again.</p>
  
   <h3>The costs of sending patients out of their area</h3> 
  <p>Adding up all the days patients have spent outside their area inappropriately in October 2020 leads to a total of 19,835 days. This equals 54 years.</p>
  <p>In just one month, the NHS trusts have spent over £10m on inappropriate Out of Area Placements. Every day a patient spends outside of their area costed on average £577 in October 2020.</p>
  <p>But the impact is not only monetary.</p>
  <p>Travelling hundreds of kilometres from friends and family to receive mental health treatment can have a negative impact on a patient’s recovery, says Vicki Nash, Mind’s Head of Policy and Campaigns.</p>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Too many people with mental health problems are being forced to travel hundreds of kilometres from their friends and family to receive the treatment they need. This can worsen people’s chances of recovery, as well as being expensive for the NHS and the taxpayer.”<br><div class="source">Vicki Nash</div></blockquote>
  
  <p>Because of a shortage of bed spaces patients are being sent out of area to get the help they need. This can be detrimental for their recovery.</p>
  
  <blockquote class="quote">“The NHS has rightly made ambitious commitments for improving mental health care. But while we are waiting for these to be delivered, thousands of people continue to face the traumatic experience of being sent away from home and separated from their support network to get the help they need.”<br><div class="source">Vicki Nash</div></blockquote>
  
  <p>When staying in units outside their usual area, patients can’t be visited by their care coordinator. Contact to the care coordinator is important to ensure continuity of care and effective discharge planning.</p>
  
   <h3>Why and where</h3> 
  <p>Patients are sent out of their area inappropriately when no bed is available for them locally.</p>
  <p>This is linked with high bed occupancy in mental health units.</p>
  <p>In order to maintain patient safety standards bed occupancy should not exceed 85%. A higher bed occupancy leads to regular bed shortages. These are impacting patient care as directing patients to the bed most suitable for their care is less likely to be possible.</p>
  <p>The current Covid-19 pandemic accelerates the situation.</p>
  <p>“The current pandemic is making this problem worse as increasing numbers of people are presenting in crisis and requiring specialist treatment,” said Dr Adrian James, President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists.</p>
  
  <blockquote class="quote">“A lack of beds in adult psychiatric inpatient units is leaving many patients with serious mental illness without the urgent treatment they need.”<br><div class="source">Dr Adrian James</div></blockquote>
  
  <p>The congestion of NHS Trusts leads to patients being sent to private organisations. In October 2020, 73% of receiving organisations were private.</p>
  <p>Sending patients to private units is associated with higher costs.</p>
  
  <h3>The trusts that are sending the most patients out of their area</h3> 
  <p>In October 2020, 58 NHS Trusts had at least one patient placed out of their area. But some trusts are sending more patients away than others.</p>
  <p>The top five sending providers accounted for more than a third of England’s total Out of Area Placement days and costs.</p>
  <p>In four out of five trusts, on average over 90% of their mental health beds were occupied between July and September 2020.</p>

  <h3>Birmingham among top sending providers</h3>
  <p>The Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust is among the trusts sending the most patients out of their area.</p>
  <p>In October 2020, all patients that have been placed out of their area inappropriately accounted for a total of 1,125 days.</p>
  <p>Compared to two years ago, the figures almost doubled — when instead they should be going down to reach the government’s aim to eliminate inappropriate Out of Area Placements by 2020/21.</p>
  <p>The highest number of Out of Area Placement days was reached in February 2020 before the pandemic started.</p>

  <p>Since XXX, the Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust has seen bed occupancy rates continuously above 90%.</p>
  <p>This matches what the Care Quality Commission reported 2019 about the trust:</p>
  
  <blockquote class="quote">“The service experienced bed pressures. Most wards had bed occupancy rates above 100%. Beds were not always available to patients on return from leave.”<br><div class="source">Care Quality Commission</div></blockquote>
  
  <h3>Where do the patients go?</h3>
  <p>In the last 12 months, the Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust has sent patients to 33 different hospitals. Almost all of them were private.</p>
  <p>Patients are often sent to the same units with Lakeside View, Priory Hospital Burgess Hill and Cygnet Churchill leading the list of receiving providers.</p>
  
  <div class="flourish-embed flourish-sankey" data-src="visualisation/4899712"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
  
  <h3>The number is believed to be higher</h3>
  <p>Data is only available for adult acute mental health inpatient care and not for out of area placements in other mental health services such as specialist mental health inpatient services or services for children and young people.</p>
  <p>Therefore, the actual number of out of area placements is believed to be higher.</p>
  
  <h3>What needs to change</h3>
